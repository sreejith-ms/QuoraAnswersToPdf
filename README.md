# QuoraToPdf

The motivation is to read quora on kindle. We all know the web browser on kindle was still experimental, so reading quora on kindle was difficult.
I have looked some of the other solutions like pocket, instapaper and some other scraping libraries.
But most of them has some limitations, like displaying all the answers.
So I just wrote a simple script on phantomjs to render all quora answers against the question and save it as a pdf. So this can be read it on kindle easily.
